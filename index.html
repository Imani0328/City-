			<h1>This was my trip to the city!</h1>
			<p>Early May I got the chance to visit my childhood friend in NYC. Now you might be confused, as I am a native New Yorker, but when I reconeected with Sam, the caterpillar, she told me of her new place in Queens. That's when I thought, "hmmm, I've seen the city plenty of times, but never through the size and eyes of a bug." I couldn't imagine such new sites at such a large size. </p>
